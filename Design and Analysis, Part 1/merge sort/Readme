Merge Sort

I implemented merge sort use C++ and objective-c. compared it with iOS SDK Cocoa sorting method with same number of random integer N. For big N, C++ has huge advantage over Objective-c. Internal iOS SDK has very good performance. 

Merge sort at the same time will caculate inversion in random number array. It will print the number of inversions
